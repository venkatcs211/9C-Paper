I have a directory containing the FR Y-9C data of a bank for every quarter since Q2 2020. The FR Y-9C is a report containing financial information of a bank at a consolidated level. The data is .csv files. The folder also contains .pdf files which should be ignored.
 Each row contains the MDRM of the data item, the description and the number agains the MDRM. For example see rows below

Report Date	Reporting date in numeric format	20200930
ID_RSSD	Reporting entity identifier	1037003
BHCK0081	NONINTEREST BEARING BALANCES AND CURRENCY AND COIN DUE FROM DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (BHC CONSOLIDATED)	1489232
BHCK0395	INT-BEARING BALANCES IN U.S. OFFICES (BHC CONSOLIDATED)	20122164

I want you to write a Python script extracting a MDRM name, description and value for that MDRM for each quarter. Also you will have to impute the value for the MDRM between quarters as well.

The output should be in the below table format which also gives examples

Period "MDRM Name" "MDRM Description" Value Remark
2020-09-30 BHCK0081 "NONINTEREST BEARING BALANCES AND CURRENCY" 1489232 "Quarterly data"
2020-10-31 BHCK0081 "NONINTEREST BEARING BALANCES AND CURRENCY" 1489800 "Imputed"
2020-11-30 BHCK0081 "NONINTEREST BEARING BALANCES AND CURRENCY" 1495624 "Imputed"
2020-12-31 BHCK0081 "NONINTEREST BEARING BALANCES AND CURRENCY" 1496826 "Quarterly data"

For imputation you can use any method but explain your choice of method.
