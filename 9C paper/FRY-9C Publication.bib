            This paper finds noninterest income is positively correlated with the total systemic risk for U.S. banks. Decomposing total systemic risk into three components, we find that noninterest income is positively related to a bank’s tail risk, positively related to a bank’s interconnectedness risk, and an insignificantly related to a bank’s exposure to macroeconomic and finance factors. We also find that noninterest income is more volatile and negatively related to interest income. Finally, we find trading and other noninterest income to be positively correlated with systemic risk. Other noninterest income, compared with trading income, has a slightly larger economic impact. (JEL G01, G18, G20, G21, G32, G38)
